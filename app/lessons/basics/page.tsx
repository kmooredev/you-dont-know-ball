      <h1>An Intro to Football (Yes - the American Kind)</h1>

          <p>
            In this lesson we're going to keep it as high-level as possible.
            There will be plenty of time to study the route tree or get lost in
            the nuances of defensive personnel packages. Instead, we're going to
            imagine that you're an alien that has crash landed on a football
            field in East Texas. We'll break down the basic terminology and
            rules, so that by the end of this lesson you'll never be lost while
            watching the game on Sunday (...or Monday, Thursday, Saturday)
          </p>
          <h3>The Objective</h3>
          <p>
            The objective of football is simple - score more points than the
            opposing team. There are a few different ways a team can score
            points, but the most common way to score points is threw the sacred
            touchdown. In order to understand what a touchdown is we need to
            understand the geography of football. The game is played on a field
            120 yards long and 53.3 yards wide. At each end of the field there
            are 10 yard long sections that are referred to as the "endzone".
            When a team has possession of the football and crosses into the
            opponent's endzone - that is a touchdown, and that team is awarded 6
            points. There are some other ways to score points that we will
            discuss later in this lesson.
          </p>
          <h3>A Game of Inches</h3>
          <p>
            You might be thinking, "Well that seems simple enough, just prance
            into the other team's endzone and win the Super Bowl", but of course
            it's not that easy. Teams are (at least in modern times) divided
            into 3 groups: offense, defense, and special teams. The offense's
            main role is to score points for their team, while the defense
            specializes in preventing the opponent from scoring. We'll get to
            special teams later - they deserve their own section - they're that
            special. Football is called a "game of inches" because the offense
            is allowed 4 attempts at moving the ball at least 10 yards towards
            the opposing endzone. These 4 attempts are referred to as "downs".
            If the offense is successful in gaining those 10 yards they are
            granted a "first down" which essentially resets the number of
            attempts back to 1. However, if the offense is not successful they
            turnover possession of the football at whichever part of the field
            the ball was located on that down - this is referred to as "turnover
            on downs". Most of the time however, teams will decide to "punt" the
            ball on the 4th and final down rather than risk a turnover on downs.
            We'll talk about punting in the special teams section of this
            lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important term to truly understand football is called "down and
            distance". This term refers to the current down and how far the
            offense needs to progress the ball until they achieve a first down.
            To elaborate further, all offensive series begin with "1st & 10"
            meaning the offense is currently on their first attempt with 10
            yards to go until they're granted a fresh set of downs. Down and
            distance is incredibly important to each team's playcalling
            strategy. For example, if it's "3rd & 10" the defense will probably
            be expecting the offense to attempt a pass rather than run the ball,
            but if it's "2nd & 2" the offense has a multitude of options to
            choose from in order to achive the first down - making it hard for
            the defense to predict what's coming.
          </p>
          <h3>Offensive Positions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Quarterback</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the most important position in all sports. The
                  quarterback (QB for short) is in charge of managing the entire
                  offensive unit. The QB is the player that receives the
                  football at the beginning of each play (we call that the snap)
                  and distributes the ball to his teammates via a handoff or
                  pass.
